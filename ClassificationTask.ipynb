    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this MLS, we are going to look into the E-commerce aggregators business. Aggregator platforms face multiple challenges due to their unorganised nature. One such problem is the task of categorising products. Since the sellers on the platform aren't organised, they tend to mislabel some of their products. This leads to confusion in the customers leading to dissatisfaction and ultimately revenue loss. The management had tried to educate the sellers on labelling through hand-outs however, that hasn't been successfull. So they are looking to automate labeling using AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 1: Auto-Labelling System**\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, our focus is on categories with the highest incidence of mislabeling. Currently, we are facing a 27% mislabeling in the system. One of the reasons this is happening is because there are a lot of common words between the skin care and hair care categories. Both of them have words like oil, powder, wash, etc. It is also confusing as sometimes products for body hair can be categorised as skin care and other times as hair care. Similarly, products for scalp can be basketed into skin care or hair care.Our job is to reduce this as much as possible.\n",

    "Management also has received concerns about the usability of the website. They aim to enhance the user experience on our platform by gaining insights into the problems customers are facing. One good source of understanding where customers are having trouble is by looking at the concerns raised by customers with call support. Understanding customer intent in chat support messages will inform the management where improvements are needed in the platform's UI/UX, making navigation and usage more intuitive.\n",

    "The response from the LLM will vary every time we re-generate it. Since we are doing an unsupervised task and since the LLM has no concrete idea about the problem beforehand, it is expected that there will be some variance. We can iterate over this multiple times and check the outputs each times to figure out the most consistent responses. By doing that, we have a higher chance of actually finding out which of the labels is most frequent. Ideally this should be done on the whole data corpus. Each time sampling a different subset (so that we can fit the context length of the LLM). But in this case-study, we do not have the whole datset (thousands of customer queries). Hence, we don't need to sample the dataset. Instead, we can run the LLM through the data multiple times and find out the most frequent query category (most probably)."

    "You are encouraged to re-run the above cell multiple times (4-5) to check which are the most consistent labels. Find 2-3 labels that are most consistent in those runs. From our runs, we found the following labels consistent - Modifying order(change order), track order, payment issues, account related issues. Of these three labels, modifying orders, payment issues and lastly track order are the most important ones to fix as they are directly related to revenue. Account related issues is a second priority. Let's look at change order, track oder and payment issues can be further investigated at large scale to understand which of these three is most problematic.\n",
